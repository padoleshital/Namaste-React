## Reason of using JSX in React.
- Write html code using createElement is very difficult and not easy to understand due to that react using JSX in react
- but can write code in react using `React.createElement` and  using JSX also.

- In below code if wite ang tag in `root.render` react will replace h1 tag for fraction of second, do not use any tag inside render tag.
- react is work in only inside 
`<div id="root">Not render</div>`
- do not use-
`<div id="root"> <h1>Shital is here</h1></div>`
